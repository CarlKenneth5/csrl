            <h1 class="headings1">Introduction of Book</h1>
            <p>Book, published work of literature or scholarship; the term has been defined by UNESCO for statistical purposes as a “non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages excluding covers,” but no strict definition satisfactorily covers the variety of publications so identified.

            Although the form, content, and provisions for making books have varied widely during their long history, some constant characteristics may be identified. The most obvious is that a book is designed to serve as an instrument of communication—the purpose of such diverse forms as the Babylonian clay tablet, the Egyptian papyrus roll, the medieval vellum or parchment codex, the printed paper codex (most familiar in modern times), microfilm, and various other media and combinations. The second characteristic of the book is its use of writing or some other system of visual symbols (such as pictures or musical notation) to convey meaning. A third distinguishing feature is publication for tangible circulation. A temple column with a message carved on it is not a book nor is a sign or placard, which, though it may be easy enough to transport, is made to attract the eye of the passerby from a fixed location. Nor are private documents considered books.<b> A book may be defined, therefore, as a written (or printed) message of considerable length, meant for public circulation and recorded on materials that are light yet durable enough to afford comparatively easy portability.</b> Its primary purpose is to announce, expound, preserve, and transmit knowledge and information between people, depending on the twin faculties of portability and permanence. Books have attended the preservation and dissemination of knowledge in every literate society.

            <h1 class="headings">History of Book</h1>
            <p>The history of books became an acknowledged academic discipline in the <i>1980s</i>. Contributions to the field have come from textual scholarship, codicology, bibliography, philology, palaeography, art history, social history and cultural history. Its key purpose is to demonstrate that the book as an object, not just the text contained within it, is a conduit of interaction between readers and words. Analysis of each component part of the book reveals its purpose, where and how it was kept, who read it, ideological and religious beliefs of the period, and whether readers interacted with the text within. Even a lack of evidence of this nature leaves valuable clues about the nature of that particular book.

            The earliest forms of writing were etched on stone slabs, transitioning to palm leaves and papyrus in ancient times.Parchment and paper later emerged as important substrates for bookmaking, introducing greater durability and accessibility. Across regions like China, the Middle East, Europe, and South Asia, diverse methods of book production evolved. The Middle Ages saw the rise of illuminated manuscripts, intricately blending text and imagery, particularly during the Mughal era in South Asia under the patronage of rulers like Akbar and Shah Jahan. Prior to the invention of the printing press, made famous by the Gutenberg Bible, each text was a unique handcrafted valuable article, personalized through the design features incorporated by the scribe, owner, bookbinder, and illustrator.

                    <h3>Reduces Stress</h3>
                    <p>Whether it’s a novel or an article, a great story will distract you from daily tasks and issues. When you have your hands on a well-written novel, it will transport you to another realm, while an engaging article will keep you focused on the present; the tension you have is automatically drained away, allowing your entire body to relax.

                    <h3>Expand Thought Process</h3>
                    <p>One of the advantages of reading non-fiction is the fact that it activates the part of your brain responsible for analytical thinking. This helps you improve your thought process, allowing you to better understand real-life concepts and making it easier for you to form your own opinions about things.

                    <h3>Chance to Live Longer</h3>
                    <p> A study was carried out to determine the life span of readers and non-readers from the adult population. The adults who actively read books were more likely to live longer than those who did not, with a difference of two years. 
                    <br>

                    The study also found that people who read more than 3 hours a week lived longer than those who were not enthusiastic readers. The study also indicated that reading magazines and other means of media were not as efficient as reading novels.

                    <h3>Better Focus</h3>
                    <p> Reading novels is considered beneficial and a requirement for literacy development. Reading can help improve a child’s or adult’s ability to focus.

                    <p>While reading, your mind is engaged in a healthy activity. Your brain is working on absorbing information, remembering details, and following the storyline. This is a great exercise for your brain.

                    <h3>Improves Quality Sleep</h3>
                    <p>
                    When you have your mind engaged in literary escape, tension is removed, and your body prepares for slumber. People who read before going to bed usually enjoy a deep and quality sleep. Introducing reading to your bedtime routine is generally not difficult and it can be a great way to replace watching TV or other activities that could actually have a negative effect on your sleep.

                    <p>By constantly stimulating your imagination and helping you develop your thinking skills, reading is ultimately going to allow you to think outside the box more often.
                    <br> 

                    Reading boosts creativity and has a positive effect on the way you are thinking. If we add this to the obvious improvements in general knowledge it also generates, it’s quite easy to see how reading can work wonders for the way you come up with solutions.
